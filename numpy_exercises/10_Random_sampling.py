# Q2. Create an array of shape (1000, 1000) and populate it with random samples from a standard normal distribution. And verify that the mean and standard deviation is close enough to 0 and 1 repectively.

# In[42]:





# Q3. Create an array of shape (3, 2) and populate it with random integers ranging from 0 to 3 (inclusive) from a discrete uniform distribution.

# In[44]:





# Q4. Extract 1 elements from x randomly such that each of them would be associated with probabilities .3, .5, .2. Then print the result 10 times.

# In[3]:


x = [b'3 out of 10', b'5 out of 10', b'2 out of 10']


# Q5. Extract 3 different integers from 0 to 9 randomly with the same probabilities.

# ## Permutations

# Q6. Shuffle numbers between 0 and 9 (inclusive).

# ## Random generator

# Q7. Assign number 10 to the seed of the random generator so that you can get the same value next time.
